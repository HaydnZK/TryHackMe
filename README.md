# TryHackMe Progress

Welcome! This is a simple repo meant to showcase my progress as I work through various TryHackMe rooms while improving my cybersecurity skills.

## Structure

The repository is organized by topic or room theme (e.g., basic red team, blue team intro).  
All lessons include screenshots, and as I progress into more difficult territory, I'll also be adding notes.

## Why This Repo?

I'm using this as both a personal archive and a public way to show my hands-on practice in cybersecurity. It helps me stay accountable and might be useful to others starting out too.

This repo is a work in progress, and I'll be updating it periodically as I progress.
